## 🛡️ Honeypot for Attack Monitoring with Automated Analysis Dashboard

**Developer:** Ravikiran.U
**Stack:** Python • Streamlit • Pandas • NumPy • VM-based Honeypot • Automated Analysis

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **honeypot-based attack monitoring system** designed to capture, analyze, and visualize real-world cyber attack behavior within a controlled environment.

The system deploys **intentionally exposed honeypot services inside a virtual machine**, records attacker interactions at the **session level**, validates and preprocesses the collected data, and performs **automated attack analysis** using rule-based and AI-ready logic.
All analyzed results are presented through an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**, enabling clear forensic inspection and actionable security insights.

## 🧠 Phase-Wise Execution Guide

### 🔹 Phase 1: Honeypot Execution

Runs the honeypot services inside a virtual machine to capture attacker interactions.

**Output structure:**

```
data/sessions/
 ├─ <session_id>/
 │   ├─ meta.json
 │   ├─ payload_*.bin
```

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Session Validation

Validates captured data and removes incomplete or corrupted sessions.

```bash
python verify_meta_integrity.py
```

Only verified sessions are forwarded for analysis.

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Data Processing & Enrichment

Converts raw session data into a structured dataset and enriches it with metadata.

```bash
python merge_sessions.py
```

**Output:**

```
output/honeypot_sessions.csv
```

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Automated Attack Analysis

Applies analytical logic to identify:

* Attack types
* Suspicious behavior
* Session-level patterns

```bash
python generate_report.py
```

**Output includes:**

* Automated attack insights
* Summary statistics
* Evidence-ready analytical reports

---

### 🔹 Phase 5: Visualization & Dashboard

Launches the interactive Streamlit dashboard.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Dashboard Features:**

* Top attacker IPs
* Attack type distribution
* Port usage analysis
* Time-series attack trends
* Geographic attack visualization
* Downloadable charts and reports

---

## 🖥️ Streamlit Dashboard

**Key Highlights:**

* Automatic graph generation
* Live monitoring of processed session data
* Clean and readable user interface
* Export to Excel and PNG formats
* Evidence-focused security insights

The dashboard strictly reads data from:

```
output/honeypot_sessions.csv
```
