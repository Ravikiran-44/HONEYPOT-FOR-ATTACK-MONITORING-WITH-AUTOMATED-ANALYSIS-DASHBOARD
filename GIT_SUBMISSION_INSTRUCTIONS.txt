Git is not available in this environment. To create a submission branch and commit locally on your machine, run these commands in PowerShell from C:\project:

# initialize git repo (if not yet a repo)
# only run `git init` if you haven't already committed this project to git
git init

# create submission branch and switch to it
git checkout -b submission

# add files required for submission
git add src run_honeypot.py test_client_interactive.py show_latest_session.py verify_meta_integrity.py REPORT.md OUTPUT.md OUTPUT.pdf EVIDENCE_README.txt tests Vagrantfile .vscode

# commit
git commit -m "Prepare submission: package, tests, report and evidence"

# optional: push to remote
# git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
# git push -u origin submission

If git is installed but you prefer GUI clients (GitHub Desktop / SourceTree), you can use those as well. If you want, I can try to run these commands for you once git is installed on the machine where the project lives.
